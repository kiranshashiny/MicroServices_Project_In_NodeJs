# MicroServices_Project_In_NodeJs

In this project I have used Node.js which accesses different databases on different instances of Node.js.

This story uses MongoDB as a backend to store information about stocks.

The various stocks information like Stocks profile, Stocks Summary and Stock Names in general are going to be stored in different Databases.
